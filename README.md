# AI-Powered Fashion Assistant  

An **AI-powered fashion assistant** that suggests personalised clothing recommendations by analysing user style and outfit compatibility.  
Built with **deep learning (9 CNNs + ResNet-50 transfer learning)** and integrated with the **ASOS API** to provide real-world product matches.  

Final project for Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp, praised by industry experts for its **accuracy (70‚Äì95%)** and practical deployment on the web.
